      <p><em>Dear You,</em></p>
     
      <p>There are a lot of things that I wanted to say for all those things are making me happy everytime. Smiles that could never explain, feeling of being insane, when being with you is so strange, all I know is I'm happy with you. That kind of feeling that you don't need to be problematic about, a feeling that even you know that there is no assurance but all I can say is that I love that kind of feeling. The joy, happiness, the butterfly in the stomach, those day dreaming and wonders are more important to me cause I am with you even when you are not with me. But I am always glad that I admire you for letting me feel everyday joyful and motivated. You are the inspiration of my day-to-day life to get up in bed and as I go to bed.</p>

      <p><em>You think you know all about it, then it seems you are wrong<br>
She hit it out of the park before it had even begun <br>
I needed sunshine in the darkness burning out <Br>
        Well now I know that I'm the fuel and she's the spark!<br></p> 
      <p>As feelings arrange deep down inside <br>
Try describing a love you can't design <br>
More and more, every inch of me is holding on <br>
This is it, all the flames are burning strong!<br></p>
      <p>We are bound to each other's hearts <br>
Caught, torn and pulled apart <br>
And to my word now I'll be true <br>
I can't stop this breaking loose <br>
        This love is like wildfire!</em><br></p>

      <p>How many times can I tell you that you're lovely just the way you are and don't let the world come and change you and don't let life break your heart. And how many times can I say that you don't have to change a thing and don't let the tide wash you away and don't let worry ever clip your wings for you are wonderful in your own way. And if you ever choose a road that leads nowhere come all alone and you can't see right from wrong nd if you ever lose yourself out there come on home and I'll sing you this song we will be singing our love song. Every time you go I'll see just how my world comes crashing round me and if you want to stay I don't think I'd for nothing more. While we're new and young we'll shine like a morning sun no matter the seasons that come and go or which way the wind blows. Cause every time you go I'll see just how my world comes crashing round me and if you want to stay I don't think I'd for nothing more.</p>
      <p><strong>Some parts of you that I admire:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em> The way you laugh without minding how it look. </li>
        <li> Your smile that would shine surrounds us. </li>
        <li> The company we shared without being judging. </li>
        <li> Being so good everytime and always being there. </em></li>
      </ul>
      <div id="con">
      <p><em>Dear You,</em></p> 
      <p>Lastly, I just wanted to say that it does not matter what we are right now for I am always grateful of what we have right now. Being a friend that I would cherish, lover is not important for I will always love you from the bottom of my heart. You are kind, lovely and so pretty!</p>
