INSTACLONE...

In this project I posted 9 simple post for Instagram clone. And in the picture, I used the bootstrap 4. 
In the navigation section, I used the bootstrap for the dropdown menu item and also for the buttons. 
And for the arrangements of the post, I used the bootstrap for the columns so that it would be easy for me to arrange it.
For the post images, I used the card layout.
